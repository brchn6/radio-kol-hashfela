# 📻 Radio Kol Hashfela — 103.6FM

> ⚠️ **Unofficial.** I'm just a listener who loves this station.
> Not affiliated with Radio Kol Hashfela or 103.6FM.

A **minimal, zero-permission-grabbing** mobile app that streams
[Radio Kol Hashfela 103.6FM](https://radio.streamgates.net/stream/1036kh)
(רדיו קול השפלה 103.6FM) — straight from the source, with no ads,
no trackers, no nonsense.

The repo contains the original Android app plus a matching iPhone/iOS
SwiftUI app under `ios/`.

It now includes notification-area Play/Stop controls, Shfela-region
nature backgrounds, ICY stream metadata display, and a quick WhatsApp
button for sending the station a pre-filled Hebrew compliment.

## What makes this different

- **No ads.** The stream plays directly — no browser, no pop-ups,
  no "skip this video" nonsense.
- **No creepy permissions.** Internet access (to play the stream)
  and notification/foreground-service access (so it can keep playing
  in the background and show Play/Stop controls).
  That's it. No camera, no mic, no contacts, no location, no
  storage, no phone state.
- **Notification controls.** Stop or restart playback from the phone's
  notification shade / top area without reopening the app.
- **Shfela scenery.** The background image is randomly chosen from
  nature photos around the Hashfela/Shfela region.
- **Now playing metadata.** Reads the station's ICY stream metadata when
  available. Currently the stream reports `Streaming Powered By Multix`,
  not real song title/artist data.
- **Track history.** Keeps the last 5 tracks on screen and adds
  a **Copy playlist** button to copy them to the clipboard.
- **WhatsApp shortcut.** Tap one button to open WhatsApp to the station
  number with the message: `שיר מעולה, אתם הכי טובים!`
- **No Google Play Services.** Not even a dependency. This app
  doesn't track you, doesn't phone home, doesn't ask who you are.
- **Open source.** Every line of code is right here. Build it yourself
  in 10 seconds.

## How to get it on your phone

### Android option 1 — Download the APK (easiest)

Go to the **Releases** tab on GitHub (or [click here][releases])
and grab the latest `.apk` file. A fresh **Latest APK** release is
published automatically after every push to `main`. Transfer it to your
phone however you like, then:

1. Open the downloaded `.apk` file on your phone
2. If prompted, allow installation from **"unknown sources"**
   (this just means you're installing outside the Play Store —
   every app store works this way)
3. Tap **Install**
4. Open the app — the radio starts playing automatically

### Android option 2 — Build it yourself

You only need:
- Linux / macOS / WSL
- Android SDK (command-line tools — the build script downloads
  nothing extra beyond what the SDK needs)

```bash
# Install the Android command-line SDK, then:
git clone https://github.com/brchn6/radio-kol-hashfela.git
cd radio-kol-hashfela
./build.sh
```

The APK lands at `build/radio.apk`. Transfer it to your phone
(ADB, USB, KDE Connect, email yourself — whatever works).

### iPhone / iOS build

The iOS app lives in `ios/RadioKolHashfela.xcodeproj` and uses SwiftUI,
AVPlayer, background audio, Control Center / lock-screen media controls,
Shfela background photos, and the same WhatsApp shortcut.

Build it on macOS with Xcode:

```bash
cd ios
./build-ios.sh
```

For installing on a real iPhone, open `ios/RadioKolHashfela.xcodeproj`
in Xcode and choose your Apple development team for signing.

## What it looks like

A random nature photo from Israel's Hashfela/Shfela area is fetched
when you open the app. The main button is **Play / Stop**, right in
the center, with quick **WhatsApp** and **Copy playlist** buttons at the bottom.

<small>*Mockup — the actual photo changes every time you open the app.*</small>

Background photos are loaded from Wikimedia Commons and feature places
around the Shfela such as Tel Azeka, Adullam-France Park, Britannia Park,
the Elah Valley, Beit Guvrin, and Eshtaol Forest.

## Tech details

- **Android API 26+** (Android 8.0+) — covers ~99% of active devices
- **iOS 15+** SwiftUI app in `ios/`
- **AAC+ stream** at 64 kbps, served directly by the station
- **Android foreground service** — keeps playing when the screen is off
  or you're using other apps
- **Android media-style notification** — compact Play/Stop action in the
  notification shade
- **iOS background audio + Now Playing controls** — supports Control Center,
  lock screen, and headset controls
- **ICY metadata reader** — polls the stream metadata and shows it in the
  app/notification when the station provides it. Real in-app music
  fingerprinting requires a recognition API/service.
- **Track history** — stores up to 5 tracks locally and lets the
  user copy the list (populated from ICY metadata)
- **WhatsApp link** — opens `wa.me/972585851036` with a pre-filled
  Hebrew message
- **~24 KB Android APK** — smaller than most favicons
- Android built with `aapt2` + `javac` + `d8` + `apksigner` — no Gradle,
  no IDE, no external libraries
- iOS builds with Xcode / `xcodebuild`

## Product paths

### Minimal (this branch — `main`)
A clean radio player with no song recognition, no API keys, no
network calls beyond the stream itself and Wikimedia background images.
Builds entirely offline with just the Android SDK. The track history
works from ICY metadata if the station sends real song info.

### Maximal (recognition via backend proxy)
Song recognition requires a server-side API key. This repo documents
the experiments:

| Service | What it needs | Docs |
|---------|--------------|------|
| **AudioTag** | API key on a backend proxy. Free quota ~10,800 sec/month. Prototype proven. | `docs/audiotag-evaluation.md` |
| **ShazamIO** | Python backend (reverse-engineered Shazam API). No official key needed. | `docs/audiotag-evaluation.md` |
| **ACRCloud** | API key + SDK. Credential plumbing exists in git history. | — |

The minimal app never embeds recognition credentials. For a production
recognition feature, all API calls go through your own backend so keys
stay server-side.
